        Instructions
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>Make the dough</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl mix together atta (whole wheat flour), salt and oil.
            Add water little by little and start mixing the dough</li>
        <li>Knead to form a smooth and soft dough. The dough should be soft, if it isn't add little more water.
            Cover and let the dough rest for 15-20 minutes. Divide the dough into 4-6 equal parts.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Make the filling</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>To make the filling, boil the potatoes first until they are completely done.Mash the potatoes and then add chopped green chili, cumin, amchur (dried mango powder), garam masala, ajwain (carom seeds), kashmiri red chili powder, salt and cilantro.</li>
        <li>Mix until everything is well combined. Taste test and adjust seasoning to taste. The stuffing for the paratha is now ready.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Make the Parathas</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the dough and divided it into 8 to 10 equal parts (depending on how big you want your parathas to be). My dough weighed around 60 grams each.
                Now, take one of the dough balls and roll it into a circle of around 4-5 inches in diameter. Apply around 1/2 teaspoon oil on the rolled dough. Then place around 2 tablespoons of the filling in the center (you can add more filling but don't overfill).</li>
            <li>Now, bring all the edges together to the center and then pinch to seal the edges.
                Then flatten the dough ball using your hands.</li>
            <li>Now using your rolling pin, roll the dough to a circle of around 7 to 8 inches diameter. Use dry atta as needed while rolling. Dip the dough ball in dry atta as and when it becomes difficult to roll and then roll again. The trick here is to apply equal pressure while rolling. If you do that, your paratha will turn round automatically.
                Heat a skillet/tawa on medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Transfer the rolled paratha onto the hot tawa. Make sure your tawa is hot before you add the paratha on it.
                Cook the side for a minute or two until it's partially cooked and then flip over. Apply oil or ghee, around 1/2 teaspoon on the half-cooked side and flip again.</li>
            <li>Now apply oil on the other side as well. Press with a spatula and cook the paratha until both sides have golden brown spots on them. Make sure to press the edges so that they get cooked as well. Repeat with the remaining dough balls and cook all the parathas similarly.
                Serve aloo paratha hot with butter, pickle and a cup of chai!</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    </ul>
