        Instructions
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add poha to a strainer, and rinse under running water until the water runs clear. Make sure all the poha is wet. Let it rest while you sauté the other ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat a heavy bottom pan on medium-high heat. Add oil to the pan and let it heat.</li>
        <li>Add cumin seeds, mustard seeds to the oil, and let them sizzle.</li>
        <li>Add the curry leaves and green chili pepper. Then add the diced onions and stir well. Saute for a minute.</li>
        <li>Add the diced potatoes. Mix well with the onions. Now cover the pan with a lid and cook on medium-low heat until the potatoes are cooked completely. Open lid and stir. Break a potato piece with the spatula to make sure it is cooked well. (It is important to cut the potatoes to small pieces so they cook quickly in 3-4 minutes)</li>
        <li>Add turmeric, salt, sugar and poha to the pan. Mix gently, until all the poha gets the yellow turmeric color. Change to low heat and cover the pan for 2 minutes. This helps to heat the poha.</li>
        <li>Turn off heat and open the lid. Sprinkle lime juice.</li>
        <li>You can taste test, and adjust salt as needed. Garnish with cilantro leaves and any optional garnishes.</li>
